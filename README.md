# LanguageVision - Vision Pro Language Learning App

## 🎯 Project Overview
LanguageVision is a Vision Pro app that teaches languages through photo description. Users select photos from their library, describe them in their target language, and receive AI-powered feedback on vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

## ✅ Phase 0 & 1 Complete - Photo Selection Flow

### What's Been Built

#### 🏗️ **Project Foundation**
- ✅ **Permissions Setup**: Added microphone, speech recognition, and photo library permissions to Info.plist
- ✅ **Data Models**: Created comprehensive models for Language, UserPreferences, PhotoData, and DetectedObject
- ✅ **Services**: Built OpenAI service and PhotoLibrary service with proper error handling
- ✅ **App Architecture**: Set up main app structure with navigation flow

#### 🎨 **Beautiful UI Components**

**1. Landing Page (`LandingView.swift`)**
- Stunning gradient background with animation
- App branding with glass material effects
- "How It Works" modal with step-by-step guide
- Privacy-first messaging
- Smooth button animations and hover effects

**2. Language Selection (`LanguageSelectionView.swift`)**
- Native and target language pickers with flag icons
- Validation to prevent selecting the same language twice
- Difficulty level selection (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Beautiful language cards with selection states
- Smooth transitions and animations

**3. Photo Selection (`PhotoSelectionView.swift`)**
- Photo library integration with permission handling
- Grid layout with thumbnail previews
- Full-size photo preview with confirmation
- Loading states and error handling
- Smooth selection animations

### 🎨 **Design Features**
- **visionOS Glass Materials**: Used `.ultraThinMaterial` for depth and transparency
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Animated gradients for visual appeal
- **Smooth Animations**: Scale effects, transitions, and loading states
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast, readable fonts, and intuitive navigation
- **Dark Mode Support**: All components work in both light and dark themes

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for state management
- **Photos Framework**: Native photo library access
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency for API calls
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

## 🚀 Next Steps - Phase 2: AI Object Detection

### What You Need to Do:

1. **Add Your OpenAI API Key**
   ```swift
   // In OpenAIService.swift, replace:
   self.apiKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
   // With your actual API key
   ```

2. **Test the Current Implementation**
   - Run the app in visionOS simulator
   - Test photo library permissions
   - Navigate through the language selection flow
   - Try selecting photos from the gallery

3. **Ready for Phase 2**
   - Object detection screen
   - AI integration with OpenAI Vision API
   - Detected objects display
   - Progress indicators and error handling

### 📱 **How to Test**

1. **Launch the App**
   - Open in Xcode
   - Select visionOS simulator
   - Build and run

2. **Test Flow**
   - Tap "Start Learning" on landing page
   - Select your native language (e.g., English)
   - Select target language (e.g., Spanish)
   - Choose difficulty level
   - Grant photo library permission
   - Select a photo from your library
   - Confirm photo selection

### 🎯 **Current Status**
- ✅ **Phase 0**: Setup & Preparation - COMPLETE
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Photo Selection Flow - COMPLETE
- 🔄 **Phase 2**: AI Object Detection - READY TO START
